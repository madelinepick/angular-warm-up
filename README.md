# angular-warm-up

This is a simple app showing how angular can update a view based on input. The 'yourName' ng-module populates the {{yourName}} template holder. 

To use this repo, fork and clone on your machine. Angular and boostrap are connected by CDNs, so no need to link anything new. Simply use this command:

<pre><code>$ open index.html to view the app.
</code></pre>
