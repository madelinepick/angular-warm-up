# angular-warm-up

This is a simple app showing how angular can update a view based on input. The 'yourName' ng-module populates the {{yourName}} template holder. 

**Use this app**

To use this repo, fork and clone on your machine. Angular and boostrap are connected by CDNs, so no need to link anything new. Simply use this command:

<pre><code>$ open index.html to view the app.
</code></pre>

**How I made this**

Always check the documentation! On the angular.js website, there is a basic code example which looks much like this app. I used that code and customized it to be styled how I wanted (I linked the bootstrap CDN and used boostrap columns etc). I added this repository as a remote, pushed the changes, and that was it.
